A variety of portable devices for battery-powered and demanding power consumption. 




32-bit CORTEX M0+ kernel 

The arm®cortex®-m0+ processor is derived from Cortex-M0 and includes a 32-bit RISC processor with 0.95 computing power 

Dhrystone Mips/mhz. At the same time, a number of new designs have been added to improve debugging and tracking capabilities, reduce the number of each instruction cycle (IPC) and improve Flash access to the two-level pipeline, etc., and incorporate energy-saving and consumption reduction technologies. Cortex-M0+ Processor full support integrated

Keil & IAR Debugger. 

The Cortex-M0+ contains a hardware debugging circuit that supports the SWD debugging interface of 2-pin.

64K Byte Flash 

Built-in is a fully integrated Flash controller that eliminates the need for external high-voltage input and is programmed by a fully built-in circuit to generate high pressure. Support for ISP, IAP, ICP features.



8K Byte RAM 

The RAM data is preserved depending on the customer's choice of a different ultra-low power mode. With its own hardware parity bit, in case the data is accidentally destroyed, when the data is read, the hardware circuit will immediately cause disruption, to ensure the reliability of the system.



The clock system has a frequency of 4M~24MHz configurable high-precision internal clock RCH. Under Configuration 16MHz, from low power mode to working mode

The type of wake-up time is 3uS, the frequency deviation in the full voltage range is <±2.5%, without the need for external expensive high-frequency crystals. 

An external crystal vibration xth with a frequency of 4M~32MHz. 

An external crystal XTL with a frequency of 32.768KHz, which mainly provides an RTC real-time clock. 

An internal clock RCL with a frequency of 32.768/38.4KHz. 

A PLL with a frequency of 4M~48MHz output. 



Working modes 

Running mode ACTIVE:CPU runs, peripheral function module runs. 

The hibernation mode Sleep:cpu stops running and the peripheral function module runs. 

Deep hibernation mode Deep SLEEP:CPU stops running, high-speed clock stops, and low-power function modules run. 



Hardware real-time clock RTC 

The RTC (Real Time counter) is a register that supports BCD data, uses 32,768Hz to refresh its clock, enables the perpetual calendar function, and the interrupt period can be configured as a year/month/day/hour/minute/second. 24/12 Hour time mode, hardware automatically fixes leap years. With precision compensation function, the highest accuracy is 0.96ppm. Accuracy compensation can be performed using an internal temperature sensor or an external temperature sensor, with software +1/-1 adjusted year/month/day/hour/minute/sec with a minimum adjustable accuracy of 1 seconds.

The RTC calendar recorder used to indicate the time and date does not clear the reserved value when the MCU is reset by external factors, and is the best choice for measuring equipment instrumentation that requires a permanent, high-precision real-time clock. 



The universal IO Port can provide up to 56 gpio ports, some of which are reused with analog ports. Each port is controlled by a separate control register bit and supports FAST IO. Supports edge trigger interrupts and level trigger interrupts to wake the MCU to work mode from a variety of ultra-low power modes. Support position bit, bit clear zero, position clear 0 operation. Support Push-pull CMOS push-pull output, open-drain open leakage output. Built-in pull-up resistor, drop-down resistor, with Schmidt trigger input filtering function. Output drive capability configurable, maximum support

12mA of current drive capability. 56 Universal IO can support external asynchronous interrupts.



Interrupt Controller 

The cortex-m0+ processor has a built-in nested vector interrupt Controller (NVIC) that supports up to 32 interrupt request (IRQ) inputs, four interrupt priorities, can handle complex logic, and can be controlled and interrupted in real time.
